sdl-jstest
==========

sdl-jstest is a simple program that lets you find out how many
joysticks SDL detected on your system, how many axes, buttons, hats
and balls they have each. It also lets you test the joysticks by
displaying the events they send or by displaying their current button,
axis, hat or ball state. sdl-jstest is especially useful if you want
to test your SDL_LINUX_JOYSTICK configuration.


Configuration
=============

The SDL behaviour of what axis is treated as a hat and which as normal
axis can be configured with the environment variable
SDL_LINUX_JOYSTICK:

 * ftp://ptah.lnf.kth.se/pub/misc/sdl-env-vars

SDL_LINUX_JOYSTICK
	Special joystick configuration string for linux. The format is
	"name numaxes numhats numballs"
	where name is the name string of the joystick (possibly in single
	quotes), and the rest are the number of axes, hats and balls
	respectively.

A simple example would be:

 $ export SDL_LINUX_JOYSTICK="'Xbox Gamepad (userspace driver)' 6 0 0"

Which makes all axis be handled as normal axis and none as hat, as
most games don't use hats.
